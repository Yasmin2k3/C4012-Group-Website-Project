        <h3>About us</h3>
        <p> We are a non-profit organization working striving to uplift the quality of life of the underprivileged section
        of the community in Ireland.<br>Our efforts have been monumental to reduce homelessness as much as possible for a
        healthy collaborative society. Your donations as fellow citizens have helped us immensely to further help those in
        need and help them to turn over a new leaf in their lives and give them a fresh start. Our staff are well trained
        and strive to provide the best services possible to the masses. </p>

        <h3>Dublin</h3>
        <P>In Dublin we’ve collaborated with other local non-profit organizations to amplify our reach and increase our
        manpower to help those in need. We’ve currently invested around 3.14 Million Euros in affordable housing projects
        and plan to end homelessness by 2030 In Dublin. The sites are currently under construction and are projected to
        house over 7000 people at completion. As far as temporary measures, homeless shelters have been allocated in both
        North and South Dublin with the help of respective City councils. </P>

    <h3>Cork</h3>
    <p>We have partnered along with the City council to provide affordable housing. Basic sanitary necessities are
      provided free of cost to those in need. The council has been grateful enough to provide higher travel discounts on
      bus routes to help us in our mission and reduce some of the financial burden so that the funds can be used in a
      more efficient way. We have 3 cafes in the city which provide employment to the people and educate them on
      important skills. A donation of 150,000 Euros from an anonymous source has boosted our reach in Cork.

    <h3>Limerick</h3>
    <p>With the current influx of students and ongoing housing crisis, affordable housing has been provided to students
      and those in need with the help of your donations. A sum of 2.75 Million Euros has been allocated to generate more
      housing projects to prevent students from camping at the universities in adverse weather. As a temporary measure,
      students have been given permission to use the Students Union at their respective universities until the housing
      projects are ready. Our well-being center in Limerick provides mental health services free of cost for people with
      mental stress related to their housing conditions or any other struggles they face. </p>
